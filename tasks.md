# Spec Tasks

## Tasks

- [ ] 1. Set up ImageKit Integration Infrastructure
  - [ ] 1.1 Add ImageKit SDK and image picker dependencies to pubspec.yaml
  - [ ] 1.2 Create ImageKit configuration and API keys setup
  - [ ] 1.3 Create ImageKit data models and DTOs
  - [ ] 1.4 Write tests for ImageKit models and configuration

- [ ] 2. Implement Data Layer (Remote Data Source)
  - [ ] 2.1 Write tests for ImageKit remote data source
  - [ ] 2.2 Create ImageKit remote data source interface
  - [ ] 2.3 Implement ImageKit remote data source with upload functionality
  - [ ] 2.4 Add error handling and custom exceptions for ImageKit operations
  - [ ] 2.5 Verify all data source tests pass

- [ ] 3. Implement Domain Layer (Repository & Use Cases)
  - [ ] 3.1 Write tests for file upload repository
  - [ ] 3.2 Create file upload repository interface
  - [ ] 3.3 Implement file upload repository implementation
  - [ ] 3.4 Write tests for generate link use case
  - [ ] 3.5 Create generate link from uploaded file use case
  - [ ] 3.6 Add domain entities for file upload operations
  - [ ] 3.7 Verify all domain layer tests pass

- [ ] 4. Implement Presentation Layer (BLoC & UI)
  - [ ] 4.1 Write tests for file upload BLoC
  - [ ] 4.2 Create file upload events and states
  - [ ] 4.3 Implement file upload BLoC with generate link functionality
  - [ ] 4.4 Create image picker service wrapper
  - [ ] 4.5 Implement UI components for file selection and upload
  - [ ] 4.6 Add loading states and error handling in UI
  - [ ] 4.7 Verify all presentation layer tests pass

- [ ] 5. Integration and Dependency Injection
  - [ ] 5.1 Write integration tests for complete upload flow
  - [ ] 5.2 Register all dependencies in dependency injection container
  - [ ] 5.3 Add file upload service to app initialization
  - [ ] 5.4 Test end-to-end file upload and link generation
  - [ ] 5.5 Verify all integration tests pass

The implementation follows Flutter's BLoC clean architecture pattern with:
- **Data Layer**: ImageKit SDK integration and remote data sources
- **Domain Layer**: Repository pattern with use cases for business logic
- **Presentation Layer**: BLoC state management with Flutter image picker
- **Generated links**: Will be sent to server via existing API infrastructure

This creates a scalable foundation where additional file upload providers can be easily added later while maintaining the same interface.
