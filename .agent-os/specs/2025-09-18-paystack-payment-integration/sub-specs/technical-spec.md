# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-09-18-paystack-payment-integration/spec.md

> Created: 2025-09-18
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

### Flutter SDK Integration
- Integrate Paystack Flutter SDK for client-side payment processing
- Implement payment initialization flow with proper error handling
- Create secure payment form with card input validation
- Handle payment callbacks and status updates
- Implement payment verification after successful transactions

### Firebase Cloud Functions Enhancement
- Extend existing payment processing functions to support Paystack
- Create secure webhook endpoint for Paystack payment notifications
- Implement payment verification logic using Paystack API
- Add order status update mechanisms
- Ensure proper error logging and monitoring

### Payment Method Screen Enhancements
- Extend existing payment method UI to include Paystack card option
- Integrate with existing payment flow architecture
- Maintain consistency with current payment method selection patterns
- Add Paystack-specific payment form components

### Order Summary Display
- Enhance existing order summary to show payment method details
- Display transaction reference and payment status
- Show payment confirmation details
- Integrate with existing order tracking system

### Payment Verification System
- Implement client-side payment status verification
- Create fallback verification mechanisms
- Add proper timeout handling for payment verification
- Ensure secure communication between client and server

### Error Handling and User Feedback
- Implement comprehensive error handling for payment failures
- Create user-friendly error messages for different failure scenarios
- Add loading states and progress indicators
- Implement retry mechanisms for failed payments
- Add proper logging for debugging payment issues

## Approach

### Frontend Implementation
1. **Paystack SDK Integration**: Integrate paystack_flutter package following existing service pattern
2. **Payment Service**: Create PaystackPaymentService following existing API service patterns
3. **UI Components**: Extend existing payment components in `lib/food/components/`
4. **State Management**: Use existing BLoC pattern for payment state management
5. **Error Handling**: Follow existing error handling patterns in the codebase

### Backend Implementation
1. **Firebase Functions**: Extend existing payment functions in `functions/` directory
2. **Webhook Handling**: Create secure webhook endpoints for Paystack notifications
3. **Database Updates**: Use existing Firestore structure for order and payment data
4. **Security**: Implement proper API key management and request validation

### Integration Points
- Leverage existing payment repository and use case patterns
- Integrate with existing cart and order management system
- Use established error handling and user feedback mechanisms
- Follow existing dependency injection patterns

## External Dependencies

### paystack_flutter Package
**Justification**: Official Paystack Flutter SDK required for secure client-side payment processing. This is the only supported way to integrate Paystack payments in Flutter applications.

**Version**: Latest stable version (^1.0.7 or higher)

**Usage**:
- Initialize payment transactions
- Handle payment forms and card input
- Process payment callbacks
- Verify payment status

### Paystack API (Backend)
**Justification**: Required for server-side payment verification, webhook handling, and secure transaction processing. The backend must communicate with Paystack API to verify payments and handle webhooks.

**Components**:
- Payment verification endpoints
- Webhook processing
- Transaction status queries
- Refund processing (if needed)

### Firebase Cloud Functions Dependencies
**Justification**: Need to add Paystack API client libraries to existing Firebase Functions for backend payment processing.

**Additional packages**:
- `axios` or `node-fetch` for HTTP requests to Paystack API
- `crypto` for webhook signature verification
- Environment variables for API keys

### Security Considerations
- API keys must be stored securely in Firebase environment configuration
- Webhook signatures must be verified to ensure request authenticity
- Payment data must be handled according to PCI compliance standards
- No sensitive payment information stored in local database

### Testing Dependencies
- Mock Paystack responses for unit testing
- Test payment cards for integration testing
- Webhook simulation for end-to-end testing
