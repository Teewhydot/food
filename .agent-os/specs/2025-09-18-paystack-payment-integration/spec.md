> Spec: Paystack Payment Integration
> Created: 2025-09-18
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Integrate Paystack payment gateway into the existing food delivery app to enable secure card payments and transaction processing. This will enhance the payment_method screen with Paystack's payment flow while maintaining the existing UI structure and adding Firebase Cloud Functions for backend payment processing.

## User Stories

1. **As a customer**, I want to complete my food order payment using my debit/credit card through Paystack so that I can securely pay for my order without leaving the app.

2. **As a customer**, I want to see my order summary and total amount before making payment so that I can verify my order details and cost before confirming payment.

3. **As a customer**, I want to receive immediate payment confirmation and order status updates so that I know my payment was successful and my order is being processed.

## Spec Scope

- **Paystack Flutter SDK Integration**: Add Paystack Flutter package and configure payment initialization within the existing payment flow.
- **Payment Method Enhancement**: Extend the current payment_method screen to include Paystack card payment option alongside existing payment methods.
- **Firebase Cloud Functions**: Implement backend payment verification and order status updates using Firebase Cloud Functions to handle Paystack webhooks.
- **Order Summary Display**: Enhance the existing cart and payment screens to show detailed order breakdown before payment initiation.
- **Payment Status Management**: Implement real-time payment status updates and error handling within the existing BLoC state management pattern.

## Out of Scope

- Multiple payment gateway integration (focus only on Paystack)
- Subscription or recurring payment functionality
- Refund processing through the mobile app
- International payment methods beyond cards
- Payment analytics dashboard
- Multi-currency support beyond Nigerian Naira

## Expected Deliverable

- **Functional Payment Flow**: Users can complete card payments through Paystack from the payment_method screen with real-time status updates.
- **Order Confirmation System**: Successful payments trigger order status updates and confirmation notifications visible in the app.
- **Backend Payment Processing**: Firebase Cloud Functions handle payment verification, webhook processing, and order management integration.
