# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Flutterwave Payment Integration
> Created: 2025-09-19
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement Flutterwave payment gateway as an additional payment option alongside the existing Paystack integration, providing users with payment method choice while maintaining identical order management and user experience. This integration will follow the same architectural patterns as Paystack to ensure consistency and maintainability.

## User Stories

### Primary Payment Flow

As a customer, I want to choose Flutterwave as my payment method during checkout, so that I can complete my food order using my preferred payment gateway.

When users reach the payment method selection screen, they will see both Paystack and Flutterwave options available. Upon selecting Flutterwave, they will be directed to a secure webview where they can enter their card details and complete the payment. The system will provide real-time feedback on payment status and automatically update the order status upon successful payment completion.

### Payment Verification and Order Management

As a customer, I want to receive immediate confirmation of my payment status, so that I know my order has been successfully placed and can track its progress.

The system will handle payment verification through Flutterwave's API, provide real-time status updates via Firebase listeners, and maintain the same order tracking experience regardless of the chosen payment method. Users will receive the same notifications and order management features whether they pay via Paystack or Flutterwave.

## Spec Scope

1. **Flutterwave Service Integration** - Complete API integration with initialization, verification, and status checking endpoints
2. **Payment Entity and Data Models** - FlutterwaveTransactionEntity with all necessary fields and helper methods
3. **BLoC State Management** - FlutterwavePaymentBloc with events and states parallel to Paystack implementation
4. **UI Components** - Webview screen for payment processing and integration with existing payment method selection
5. **Firebase Cloud Functions** - Backend endpoints for secure Flutterwave API communication and webhook handling
6. **Real-time Payment Verification** - Firebase listeners for payment status updates and order state synchronization

## Out of Scope

- Saved cards functionality for Flutterwave
- Alternative payment methods beyond card payments (bank transfers, USSD, etc.)
- Replacement or removal of existing Paystack integration
- Changes to existing order management or tracking workflows
- Multi-currency support beyond Nigerian Naira

## Expected Deliverable

1. Users can select Flutterwave as a payment option and complete transactions successfully through secure webview
2. Payment verification works in real-time with proper order status updates and user notifications
3. Complete architectural parity with Paystack including entities, services, BLoCs, and Firebase functions while maintaining code separation
