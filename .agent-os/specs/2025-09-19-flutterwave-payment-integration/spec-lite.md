# Flutterwave Payment Integration - Lite Summary

Implement Flutterwave payment gateway as an additional payment option alongside the existing Paystack integration, providing users with payment method choice while maintaining identical order management and user experience. This integration will follow the same architectural patterns as Paystack including entities, services, BLoCs, webview screens, and Firebase Cloud Functions to ensure consistency and maintainability without implementing saved cards functionality.

## Key Points
- Add Flutterwave as a secondary payment gateway option alongside existing Paystack
- Follow identical architectural patterns as Paystack implementation for consistency
- Implement complete payment flow with webview, entities, services, and Firebase functions
